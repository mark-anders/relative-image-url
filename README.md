# relative-image-url
The Stack Overflow question that I found asking if relative image links were supported said "No", but they are.

The following link is what's used below.

    ![Kiku](images/Kiku.jpg)
    
**Note:** If your image's filename has **spaces**, you need to encode it as URL, replacing **spaces** by `%20`, do it [here](https://www.urlencoder.org)
