# relative-image-url
The Stack Overflow question that I found asking if relative image links were supported said "No", but it's more complicated.

It works for jpg's:

    ![Kiku](images/Kiku.jpg)

![Kiku](images/Kiku.jpg)

But it doesn't work for svg's:
    
    ![Kiku](images/question.svg)   

![Kiku](images/question.svg)
